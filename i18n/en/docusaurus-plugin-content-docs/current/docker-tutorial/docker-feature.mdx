# Docker - Features

Some of the key features of **Docker** are as follows:

- Easy and Faster configuration
- Increase productivity
- Application Isolation
- Swarm
- Routing Mesh
- Services
- Security Management

### Easy and Faster configuration

- This is a key feature of `docker` that helps us to configure the system easily and faster.

- We can `deploy` our code in less time.

### Increase productivity

- **Docker** easing `technical configuration` and `rapid deployment of application`.

### Application Isolation

- It provides `containers` that are used to run applications in isolation environment.

### Swarm

- It is a `clustering` and `scheduling` tool for **Docker Containers**. It allows the user to manage multiple `containers` deployed across multiple host machines.

### Routing Mesh

- It routes the incoming requests for `published ports` on available `nodes` to an `active container`.

### Services

- **Services** is a list of `tasks` that lets us specify the state of the `container` inside a `cluster`.

### Security Management

- It allows us to save secrets into the `swarm` itself and then choose to give `services` access to certain secrets.

- It includes some important commands to the engine like `secret inspect`, `secret create` etc.
