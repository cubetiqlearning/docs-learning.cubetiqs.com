# Spring Boot Kotlin - Architecture

This chapter will explain you about **Architecture** on **Spring Boot**.

### Spring Boot Architecture

Before you can learn more about **Spring Boot**, you should first understand the **Architecture of Spring Boot**, which has the following four:

- **Presentation Layer**: A layer that handles **HTTP Requests**, translates the **JSON Parameter** into an object, verifies the request, and then passes it on to the business layer.

- **Business Layer**: a layer that handles all business logic

- **Persistence Layer**: A layer that handles all storage logic and converts business objects into database rows.

- **Database Layer**: A layer that handles **CRUD Operations**

### Spring Boot Flow Architecture

The image above represents the `Basic Flow Architecture` for **Project Spring Boot**:

- **Model**: has the role of creating a `table` and communicates with the `database`.
- **Repository**: has the role of generating data, modifying data, deleting data, and displaying data from the Database, and it interacts with the `Model`.
- **Service**: has the role of creating `business logic` for the program and it interacts with `Repository` and to be able to use the `Repository` in the `Service` you need to inject the dependency of the repository.
- **Controller**: has the role of creating an `http request endpoint` for the `client` to `request` what the client wants, such as creating data, modifying data, deleting data, and displaying data, and it interacts with `Service` and to be able to use `Service` in the `Controller` you need to inject the dependency of the service.
- **Client**: the `client side` that is responsible for requesting to the `Controller` endpoint.
