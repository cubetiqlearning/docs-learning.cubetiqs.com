# Spring Boot Kotlin - Starter Web

This chapter will explain to you what **Dependency Starter Web** is and what you can do with **Spring Boot**.

### Spring Boot Starter Web

It has two main features of `spring-boot-starter-web`:

- It is compatible for `web development`
- Auto `configuration`

If you want to use this `dependency` you need to add this `dependency` in the `build.gradle.kts` file:

```shell
dependencies {
  implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
}
```

In **Spring Web Dependency** there are **Spring MVC**, **REST** and **Tomcat** `server`.
