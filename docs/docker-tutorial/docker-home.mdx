# Docker - Home

### What is Docker?

- In simple terms, **Docker** is a program that simplifies the process of creating, managing, and distributing applications. It does this by enabling all computer operating systems to download and run any program with ease and without much configuration.

- **Docker** uses a `container` to connect to a computer's operating system to execute programs. It allows applications to use the same `Linux kernel` as a `system` built into a computer, rather than creating an entire `virtual operating system`.

- **Docker** was created by `Kamel Founadi`, `Solomon Hykes` and `Sebastien Pahl` and uses the `Golang Programming Language`. **Docker** has been around for <CountYearComponent startYear={2013} /> years now, as of March 20, 2013.

- **Docker** integrates with many components such as **Docker client**, **Docker server**, **Docker machine**, **Docker hub**, **Docker composes**, etc.

### What is a Docker Container?

- **Docker Container** is a `lightweight virtual machine`. It allows developers to package software that includes all the `libraries` and `dependencies` associated with the application, and ship it individually as a package.

- The advantage of using a `docker container` is that you do not need to allocate `RAM` and `disk` space to execute any program, it will automatically generate storage and space according to the requirements of the program.

### What is a Virtual Machine?

- **Virtual Machine** is a program that allows us to download and use different operating systems (`Windows`, `Linux`, and `Debian`) at the same time on our machine. The operating system on which the `virtual machine` is running is called `virtualized operating systems`. All of these **Virtualized Operating Systems** are able to execute applications and perform tasks like real operating systems.

### Why use Docker?

![Why Docker](/img/docs/why-docker.jpg)

- **Docker** is designed to benefit both the Developer and System Administrator. There are the following reasons to use **Docker**:
  - **Docker** allows us to easily install and run `software` without worrying about setup or `dependencies`.
  - **Developers** use **Docker** to eliminate machine problems, that is, when we run programs on Docker, it is lighterweight than running programs directly.
  - **Operators** use **Docker** to run and manage apps in isolated `containers` for better compute density.
  - **Enterprises** use **Docker** to securely built agile `software delivery pipelines` to ship new application features faster and more securely.

### Advantages of Docker

- The advantages of **Docker** are as follows:
  - It uses less `memory`.
  - It provides `lightweight virtualization`.
  - It does not a require full operating system to run applications.
  - It allows you to use a `remote repository` to share your `container` with others.

### Disadvantages of Docker

- The disadvantages of **Docker** are as follows:
  - It increases complexity due to an additional layer.
  - In **Docker**, it is difficult to manage large amount of `containers`.
  - Some features such as `container self-registration`, `containers self-inspects`, copying files form `host` to the `container`, and more are missing in the `Docker`.
  - **Docker** is not a good solution for applications that require `rich graphical interface`.

### Docker Engine

- It is a `client server application` that contains the following major components:
  - A `server` which is a type of long-running program called a `daemon process`.
  - The `REST API` is used to specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to the `daemon` and instruct it what to do.
  - The `client` has a `command line interface` for submitting commands to the `server`.
