# Docker - Architecture

Before learning the **Docker architecture**, first, you should know about the **Docker Daemon**.

### What is Docker daemon?

- **Docker daemon** runs on the `host operating system`. It is responsible for running containers to manage `docker services`. It offers various **Docker objects** such as `images`, `containers`, `networking`, and `storage`.

### Docker architecture

- **Docker** follows **Client-Server architecture**, which includes the three main components that are `Docker Client`, `Docker Host`, and `Docker Registry`.

#### 1. Docker Client

- **Docker client** uses `commands` and `REST APIs` to communicate with the **Docker Daemon (Server)**. When a client runs any docker command on the `docker client terminal`, the client terminal sends these docker commands to the **Docker daemon**. **Docker daemon** receives these commands from the `docker client` in the form of `command` and `REST API's request`.

#### 2. Docker Host

- **Docker Host** is used to provide an environment to execute and run applications. It contains the `docker daemon`, `images`, `containers`, `networks`, and `storage`.

#### 3. Docker Registry

- **Docker Registry** manages and stores the **Docker images**.

- There are two types of `registries` in the **Docker**:
  - **Public Registry** - is also called as **Docker hub**.
  - **Private Registry** - It is used to share `images` within the enterprise.

### Docker Objects

- There are the following **Docker Objects**:

#### Docker Images

- **Docker images** are the `read-only binary templates` used to create **Docker Containers**.

#### Docker Containers

- **Containers** are the structural units of **Docker**, which is used to hold the entire package that is needed to run the application. The `advantage of containers` is that it requires very less resources.

- In other words, we can say that the `image` is a `template`, and the `container` is a `copy of that template`.

#### Docker Networking

- Using **Docker Networking**, an isolated package can be communicated. **Docker** contains the following `network drivers`:
  - **Bridge** - It is a default `network driver` for the `container`. It is used when `multiple docker` communicates with the `same docker host`.
  - **Host** - It is used when we don't need for `network isolation` between the `container` and the `host`.
  - **None** - It disables all the `networking`.
  - **Overlay** - It offers `Swarm services` to communicate with each other. It enables `containers` to run on the different `docker host`.
  - **Macvlan** - It is used when we want to assign `MAC addresses` to the `containers`.

#### Docker Storage

- **Docker Storage** is used to store data on the `container`. **Docker** offers the following options for the `Storage`:
  - **Data Volume** - It provides the ability to create `persistence storage`. It also allows us to `name volumes`, `list volumes`, and `containers associates with the volumes`.
  - **Directory Mounts** - It is one of the best options for `docker storage`. It `mounts` a `host's directory` into a `container`.
  - **Storage Plugins** - It provides an ability to connect to `external storage platforms`.
