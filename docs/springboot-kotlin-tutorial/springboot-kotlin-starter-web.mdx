# Spring Boot Kotlin - Starter Web

This chapter will explain to you what **Dependency Starter Web** is and what you can do with **Spring Boot**.

### Spring Boot Starter Web

It has two main features of `spring-boot-starter-web`:

- It is compatible for `web development`
- Auto `configuration`

If you want to use this `dependency` you need to add this `dependency` in the `build.gradle.kts` file:

```shell
dependencies {
  implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
}
```

In **Spring Starter Web Dependency** there are **Spring MVC**, **REST** and **Tomcat** `server`.

### Create a Simple Web Application

You can create a `web controller` for creating web applications in a simple way in such a `folder` `src/main/kotlin/com/cubetiq/springboot/HelloController.kt`:

```kotlin
package com.cubetiq.springboot

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController

@RestController
class HelloController {
    @GetMapping("/")
    fun index(): String {
        return "Greetings from Spring Boot!"
    }
}
```

After you have created a `web controller` and written the above code, you can `run` the `project`, and after a successful `run`, you need to open a `browser` and type in the following address: `http://localhost:8080` and on this page you will see the `Greetings from Spring Boot results!` .

### Summary

- After studying this chapter, you will be able to understand more about **Spring Boot Start Web Dependency**.
