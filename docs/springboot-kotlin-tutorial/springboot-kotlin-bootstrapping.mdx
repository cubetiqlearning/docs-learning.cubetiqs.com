# Spring Boot Kotlin - Bootstrapping

This chapter will explain you how to perform bootstrapping on a **Spring Boot** application.

### Spring Initializer

- There are many ways to create a **Project Spring Boot**, but in this tutorial we will take you to create a **Project Spring Boot** on the <a href="https://start.spring.io/" target="_blank">Spring Initializer</a> website.

![Spring Initializer Dashboard](/img/docs/start-spring-io.jpg)

- In the image above, you will see a dashboard that is used to create a **Project Spring Boot**. We will now take you through each point in this dashboard

  - **Project**: In this section, you are required to select the type of **Project Manager** _(Project Manager is the one who can properly organize the dependencies that you need to use in the project, and on the other hand can set the version of the project and more, etc.)_ And for project managers, there are two as follows:

    - **Maven** is a project management tool that is open-source software and is primarily used for **Java Project**.
    - **Gradle** is an open-source automation tool based on the concepts of **Apache Maven** and **Apache Ant**.

    The reason you should use **Gradle** is because it avoids tracking the same tasks and it only tracks the tasks that have been changed, so it provides faster processing.

  - **Language**: In this section you are required to select the following language types:

    - **Java** is a widely used programming language running on millions of devices including PCs, laptops, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices and more. The synctax of the **Java** language is dependent on the **C** and **C++** languages.
    - **Kotlin** is a new open source programming language similar to **Java** and **JavaScript**. It is a rich language that brings together many functions in one place. Kotlin currently runs on JVMs.
    - **Groovy** is object oriented and has a Java-like format. **Groovy** code is compiled into **Java Bytecode** and can run on any platform with **JRE**.

  - **Spring Boot**: In this section you are required to select the version of **Spring Boot**, so you should choose the latest version.

  - **Project Metadata**: In this section you are required to fill in some project related information:

    - **Group** specifies the name of the `package`.
    - **Artifact** is the name of the `Application`.
    - **Name** same as `Artifact`.
    - **Description** as a description of the `Project`.
    - **Package name** same as `Group`.
    - **Packaging** is a selection of types of `packaging` for `build` to take to use, and there are two:
      - **Jar** is a **Java Application Archive** that can run programs on your computer.
      - **War** is a **Web Application Archive** that can only run programs on the server.
    - **Java** is a selection of `versions` of **Java**, so you can choose which `version` you want to use.

  - **Dependencies**: In this section, you are required to select a type of dependency, so you can select the dependencies as shown in the picture or select only one **Spring Web**.

  After this you will see three more buttons below:

  - **GENERATE**: a button for creating a **Spring Boot Project**.
  - **EXPLOER**: a button to view the **Structure of Spring Boot Project**.
  - **SHARE...**: a button for sharing **Spring Boot Project**.

- After clicking the **Generate** button, it provides a `zip file` as shown below:

![Zip File Project](/img/docs/zip-file-project.jpg)

- Then you can extract the `zip file`, then open the **IntelliJ IDEA IDE** and open the project you just extracted.

![IntelliJ](/img/docs/intellij.jpg)

- After opening the project in the **IntelliJ IDEA IDE**, you have to wait for the **IntelliJ IDEA IDE** to `sync` the project completely before you can start developing this project.

![Start Project Spring IntelliJ](/img/docs/start-project-spring-intellij.jpg)

- After the project is `synced`, you can take a look at the project structure as shown below:

![Spring Boot Starter Folder](/img/docs/springboot-starter-folder.jpg)

- The image below is a project structure that was extracted from a `zip file` and has not been properly configured.

![Spring Boot Before Delete Unused File](/img/docs/springboot-before-delete-unused-file.jpg)

- The image below is a project structure that deletes useless folders or files and organizes them properly.

![Spring Boot After Delete Unused File](/img/docs/springboot-after-delete-unused-file.jpg)

- The image below is the `build.gradle.kts` file, where you can add additional `dependencies` or modify `versions` of **Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot**, etc.

![Spring Boot Grandle Build](/img/docs/springboot-grandle-build.jpg)

- Find out more about `build.gradle.kts` file:

```shell
import org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile

plugins {
  id("org.springframework.boot") version "2.5.1"
  id("io.spring.dependency-management") version "1.0.11.RELEASE"
  kotlin("jvm") version "1.5.10"
  kotlin("plugin.spring") version "1.5.10"
  kotlin("plugin.jpa") version "1.5.10"
}
```

- **Plugins**: In addition to the **Kotlin Gradle plugin**, the default `configuration` is the `kotlin-spring-plugin` declaration, which allows the `classes` and `methods` to be open, allowing other classes to be `inherited`*(classes in Kotlin are not As in Java, if you do not put the open keyword in front of the class, it will be the final class)*. On the other hand, to be able to use `Kotlin non-nullable properties` with **JPA**, you need to have the **Kotlin JPA plugin** enabled. This will create `no-arg constructors` for all classes `annotated` with `@Entity`, `@MappedSuperclass`, or `@Embeddeable`.

```shell 
group = "com.webapp"
version = "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
java.soruceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
```

- Above is a `group` that is the `package name`, `version` is the version of the `application` that was `built`, `java.soruceCompatibility` is the setting for the `version` of **Java** for `build`.

```shell
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
```

- **Repositories**: Set the location for downloading `dependencies` to use in the **Project**, as when you put `mavenCentral()`, it will go to the <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central" target="_blank">Maven Central Repository</a> download site.

```shell
dependencies {
  implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa")
  implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web")
  implementation("com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin")
  implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect")
  implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8")
  runtimeOnly("com.h2database:h2")
  testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test")
}
```

- **Dependencies**: The three **Kotlin** libraries required for **Project Spring Boot** are as follows:
  - **kotlin-stdlib-jdk8**: The **Kotlin** library standard of the **Java 8 Variant**.
  - **kotlin-reflect**: A **Kotlin** reflection library.
  - **jackson-module-kotlin**: Provides support for `serialization/deserialization` of **Kotlin** classes and data classes.

  And there are some `dependencies` that belong to **Spring** and **Database** as follows:
  - **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**: A **Spring Data JPA** library.
  - **spring-boot-starter-web**: A **Spring Web** library.
  - **h2**: The library of the **H2 Database**.
  - **spring-boot-starter-test**: **Spring Test** library.

  On the other hand, in every download `dependencies`, there is the use of different functions, such as `implementation` used to run those `dependencies`, starting from the `implementation` (when coding), `runtimeOnly` is only run at `run time` and the `testImplementation` is run during the `test`.

```shell
tasks.withType<KotlinCompile> {
  kotlinOptions {
    freeCompilerArgs = listOf("-Xjsr305=strict")
    jvmTarget = "11"
  }
}
```

- **Compile options**: The main feature of **Kotlin** is `null-safety`, as it solves a lot of problems when `compiling time`, it avoids the famous exception `NullPointerException` at `run time`. To add this `null-safety` function, you need to add `-Xjsr305` *compiler* with *flag* with `strict`.

```shell
tasks.withType<Test> {
  useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

- **Test options**: A registration for `testing` using **JUnit5**.

- The following image is in the `application.properties` file, but we have modified the file `extension` to `yml`, and in this file we need to write a `configuration` with **H2 Database** to be able to connect to **H2 Database**.

![Spring Boot Config H2 Database](/img/docs/springboot-config-h2-database.jpg)

- The image below is the file that is the **Main Application** in **Spring Boot** and when you press the <span style={{color: 'green'}}>â–¶</span> button to execute the program.

![Spring Boot Application Starter](/img/docs/springboot-application-starter.jpg)

- The image below is the **Console Logger** where the program is executed.

![Spring Boot Starter 8090](/img/docs/springboot-starter-8090.jpg)

- The image below is when the program is successfully executed, then go to view the results on the browser. The reason it displays the word **`Whitelabel Error Page`** is because you have not yet created a **Controller** for this page.

![Spring Boot Starter 8090 Result](/img/docs/springboot-starter-8090-result.jpg)

- The image below will take you to create a file called **TestController**.

![Test Contoller Folder](/img/docs/test-contoller-folder.jpg)

- In the **TestController** file, there will be a path creation for the `'/testing-page'` and a **Get** function.

![Test Contoller File](/img/docs/test-contoller-file.jpg)

- After creating a controller and executing the program again, and after successful execution, go to the results on the `'/testing-page'` will see the following results:

![Test Contoller File Result](/img/docs/test-contoller-file-result.jpg)

### Summary

- After studying this chapter, you will be able to create your own **Project Spring Boot**.
